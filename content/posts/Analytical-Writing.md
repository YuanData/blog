### Analytical Writing
| English | 中文 |
|---------|------|
| "Social media isolates people more than it connects them." | "社交媒體使人更加孤立，而不是讓人更加聯結。" |
| While social media was initially designed to connect people, to some extent, it has indeed made many feel isolated. <br> Firstly, the time people spend on social media reduces face-to-face interaction, which is foundational to building deep interpersonal relationships. <br> Secondly, the highlights of people's lives often showcased on social media can make some users feel that their lives are inferior to others, leading to feelings of isolation. <br> However, social media also certainly keeps many distant friends and families connected. In conclusion, while I believe there are both pros and cons to social media, it does indeed exacerbate feelings of isolation in certain situations. | 雖然社交媒體初衷是為了讓人們更加聯結，但在某種程度上，它確實使許多人感到孤立。 <br> 首先，人們在社交媒體上花費的時間減少了面對面的互動，這種真實的互動是建立深層人際關係的基礎。 <br> 其次，社交媒體上經常展示的是人們生活中的精彩時刻，這可能使某些用戶感到他們的生活不如其他人，從而感到孤立。 <br> 然而，社交媒體也確實使許多遠方的朋友和家人保持聯絡。總的來說，我認為社交媒體既有利也有弊，但它確實在某些情況下增加了人們的孤立感。 |
| "The rise of remote work will render the traditional office setup obsolete." | "遠程工作的興起將使傳統的辦公室模式變得過時。" |
| Indeed, remote work has brought flexibility for many workers, but the traditional office setup is unlikely to disappear completely. <br> Remote work allows employees to operate from home, cutting down on commute time and costs. However, offices provide a collaborative environment that's crucial for many businesses. <br> Face-to-face interactions can bolster bonds between teams and foster innovation. Thus, the future of work may be a blend of remote work and office collaboration. | 遠程工作的確為許多工人帶來了靈活性，但傳統的辦公室模式不太可能完全消失。 <br> 遠程工作允許員工在家工作，減少了通勤時間和成本。然而，辦公室提供了一個合作的環境，這對於許多業務至關重要。 <br> 面對面的交流可以加強團隊之間的聯結，並促進創新。因此，未來的工作模式可能是遠程工作和辦公室工作的結合。 |
| "Education should emphasize practice more than theory." | "教育應該更多地強調實踐而不是理論。" |
| I believe that education should strike a balance between theory and practice. <br> Theory provides students with a foundational understanding, while practice allows them to apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios. Whether it's in engineering, arts, or social sciences, solely having theory or practice isn't enough to ensure the holistic development of students. | 我認為教育應該平衡理論和實踐。 <br> 理論為學生提供了知識的基礎，而實踐則讓他們將這些知識應用於真實世界的情境中。 <br> 無論是在工程學、藝術還是社會科學中，僅僅擁有理論或實踐都不足以確保學生的全面發展。 |
| "Success relies more on persistence than on talent." | "成功更多地依賴於持久性，而不是天賦。" |
| While talent is indeed significant for achieving exceptional feats in certain areas, persistence is often the key to long-term success. <br> Many successful individuals have encountered failures throughout their careers, but their persistence enabled them to overcome these challenges and continue pursuing their goals. Therefore, I believe persistence is more critical than talent. | 雖然天賦對於在某些領域取得突出成就確實很重要，但持久性往往是長期成功的關鍵。 <br> 許多成功的人在他們的職業生涯中都遇到了失敗，但他們的堅持使他們能夠克服這些挑戰，並繼續追求他們的目標。 <br> 因此，我認為堅持比天賦更加重要。 |
| "The burden of environmental protection should be borne by governments, not corporations." | "環境保護的負擔應該由政府而不是企業來承擔。" |
| Environmental protection requires collective efforts from governments, corporations, and the public. <br> Governments can enact policies and regulations, but corporations, which produce pollution in their daily operations, should also shoulder the responsibility for environmental protection. <br> Consumers can also play a part by supporting eco-friendly companies. Thus, I believe the responsibility for environmental protection should be shared among all stakeholders. | 環境保護需要政府、企業和公眾的共同努力。 <br> 政府可以制定政策和法規，但那些在日常運營中產生污染的企業也應該承擔環境保護的責任。 <br> 消費者也可以通過支持環保公司來發揮作用。因此，我認為環境保護的責任應該由所有利益相關者共同承擔。 |
